*Works by Default* is a blog written by Amber Yust. The name references a common goal in
her line of work: to make software, systems, and processes that will do that right thing
if left to their own devices.

Entries from 2009-2010 were originally published on *Up Past Midnight*, her previous (and now
defunct) blog. Amber also occasionally writes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aiiane)
and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/116797686750161798768).
